For comparitive designs of different approaches to intrument geometry for version 2. This repository specifically looks at fresh approaches to instrument representation. A major requirement is the ability to rapidly extract key detector information required for data reduction. See [requirements](https://github.com/mantidproject/documents/blob/master/Design/Instrument-2.0/requirements-v2.md) for more context.

This repository is designed to host several prototypes aiming for the same purposes.
